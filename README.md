💡 Week 1 – Basic UI/UX Design Tasks
This repository includes my work for Week 1 of my UI/UX internship training. The tasks focused on building a strong foundation in UI/UX design principles, tools, and visual basics. These exercises helped me understand the difference between UI and UX, core usability principles, and design thinking methods.

📌 What’s Included
🧠 UI vs UX
UI (User Interface): Focuses on the visuals – buttons, fonts, colors, and overall layout.

UX (User Experience): Focuses on how the user interacts – usability, simplicity, and satisfaction.

Example comparisons included house design analogies for better understanding.

🎯 Usability Principles
✅ Consistency: Same behavior for similar actions.

✨ Simplicity: Clean design, easy-to-understand labels.

🔄 Feedback: Let users know when an action is complete.

👀 Visibility: Important actions should be easy to access.

🧩 Design Frameworks
Design Thinking Process:
Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test

Double Diamond Model:
Discover 🔍 → Define 📝 → Develop 🛠️ → Deliver 🚀

🛠️ Tools Setup (Figma)
Practiced using Figma – frames, components, grids, layers, etc.

Designed and prototyped screen layouts using best practices.

🎨 Visual Design Basics
Typography, color schemes, spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy were explored in detail to understand the fundamentals of attractive and functional interfaces.

🖼️ App Screen Recreations
Recreated the UI layouts of popular apps including:

WhatsApp

YouTube

Spotify

YT Music
Also created basic wireframes for better structural understanding.

🚀 Purpose
This week’s work helped me set the groundwork for my journey in UI/UX design. By combining theory with hands-on practice, I started understanding how to build designs that are not only visually appealing but also user-friendly.
